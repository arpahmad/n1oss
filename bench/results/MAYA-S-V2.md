# Maya-S v2 against the FP8 model (2026-10-07, Uranus)

`GLM-5.3-Flash-Maya-S-v2-IQ2_XXS` (96.5 GB, 3 shards): the same IQ2_XXS gate/up experts with error-feedback rounding as
v1, the down projections one step up everywhere - IQ3_XXS in the first and last four MoE layers (3-6, 41-44), IQ2_S in
the rest - and the rest as v1 (Q6_K attention, shared experts, dense layers, embeddings and output; Q8_0 small KDA
projections and the DSA indexer; F32 router and mixing weights; the NextN block with Q2_K/Q3_K experts).
Recipe: `tools/n1os_quant/recipes/maya-s-v2.json`, from v1's calibration statistics; 255 min on Uranus.

## Distribution match on held-out text

The same yardstick as v1 ([MAYA-S-V1.md](MAYA-S-V1.md)): the FP8 model's top-64 log-probabilities on 8 held-out
sequences (7,672 positions), Maya-S through the engine's one-token decode path (`tools/n1os_quant/kl_eval.py`).

| Perplexity | 3.51 | 4.31 | **4.19** |
| Top-1 accuracy on the actual next token | 71.5% | 68.1% | **68.8%** |
| Size | | 90.1 GB | 96.5 GB |

Reading: the down projections were where v1's error was largest for the size; one step up there (+6.4 GB) cuts the
KL by 12% overall and by 17% on tool calls, the format v1 matched worst.
