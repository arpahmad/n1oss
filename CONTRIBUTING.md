# Contributing to n1os

Reports and pull requests are welcome. These are what helps most.

## A speed report or a new machine

Open an issue with:

- **`./n1os.sh --bench`** (n1os stopped) **then `./n1os.sh --report`**, and attach `n1os-report.txt`. Windows:
  `START-N1OS.bat --bench` / `--report`. The report includes the bench results.
- **A build from source without the installer** is fine too. Send the same things by hand:
  - the exact engine command and environment (`STRATA_GLM_*` settings);
  - GPUs (model, VRAM, PCIe generation and width as `nvidia-smi` shows them), CPU, RAM, disk;
  - model and context length;
  - the engine log's `glm fast:`, `glm split`, `glm stat:` and `glm spec:` lines.

  For numbers comparable with the README's table, measure the way `--bench` does: three questions of 256 tokens,
  greedy, thinking off, one short warm-up first; prefill (reading the prompt) at 2048 and 8192 tokens.

Name your n1os version (`VERSION`, or the commit). Say what you measured and what you didn't.

## A bug

Run `./n1os.sh --report` right after the failure and attach `n1os-report.txt`. If the engine stopped, add the end
of its log (the `.log` next to your `n1os-*.json`).

## A pull request

- **Base it on `main`** and keep it to one topic.
- **Measure before and after** on your hardware, same harness, and put the numbers in the description. If the
  output changes (it can: which expert runs on the CPU or the GPU changes the last bits), say so.
- **New settings** are `STRATA_GLM_*` environment variables, off or at today's behaviour by default unless measured
  better, with a row in the README's Tuning table.
- **AMD (HIP) and other backends:** keep NVIDIA's code path unchanged (`#if defined(STRATA_USE_HIP)`). We can't test
  AMD ourselves, so we merge AMD changes on your measurements once NVIDIA builds and behaves the same.
- **Before merging, we build every NVIDIA target** and run the engine's parity tests (`glm_*_parity --selftest`),
  the server tests (`python -m unittest serve.test_server serve.test_tools serve.test_mcp serve.test_detok`) and a
  decode / prefill A/B on Tesla V100s (one GPU and two).
- **Areas where help is welcome:**
  - decode speed when every expert fits in VRAM (kernel launches and host waits dominate there);
  - Windows with NVIDIA GPUs;
  - AMD;
  - consumer GPUs from 12 to 32 GB;
  - docs.

Every merged change ships in a release (`CHANGELOG.md`), with credit.
